# Polarflake

Polarflake is a NixOS configuration dedicated to computer learning. This configuration was created specifically for the IUT in La Rochelle, France. 

It provides all the tools, software, services and systems needed to follow the FullStack Developer course without missing a single tool.

The aim of this NixOS configuration is to provide new students with a Linux configuration that is quick and easy to install, so that they are ready for the next three years.

## Installation

To install this configuration, you first need to install NixOS yourself, then download the configuration and install it using a simple command : 

```sh
nix run nixpkgs#git -- clone https://github.com/Altaks/NixOS-polarflake && cd NixOS-polarflake && ./install.sh 
```
