## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can as a user report a security vulnerability about the base configuration, not the forks : 

- Through GitHub security vulnerabilities report system in the "Security" tab of this project, using the "Report a vulnerability" button
- Via email to `altaks.me@gmail.com`.
- Via Discord messages to `altakxs` prefixed with "NixOS Polarflake security issue"
